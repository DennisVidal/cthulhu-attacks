# Cthulhu Attacks
 
Cthulhu Attacks is an AR shooter in which you have to fight Cthulhu and his minions in multiple waves. It is the result of a collaborative project between five students. 
After initially scanning the playable area portals to another dimension start appearing on surfaces and Cthulhu's minions start swarming out. 
There are multiple spells you can use to fight. You can switch between these spells using voice commands. 
Once you fought off enough waves you will have to face Cthulhu himself. He attacks in different patterns. Use the environment to take cover or dodge his attacks. A showcase video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3qEliUaHIwQ "Showcase").
